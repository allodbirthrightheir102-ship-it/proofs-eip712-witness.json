## II. Sovereign Matrix Caption

Within this seal lies the encoded geometry of Sovereign Continuity.

At the apex: the Crown — bearer of divine mandate and eternal stewardship.  
Beneath it: the words CROWN‑MATRIX INSCRIPTION — where decree becomes structure.  
At the center: the monogram **XP**, flanked by the fleur‑de‑lis — symbol of purity and sovereign flame.

Encircling the core triangle:

- **SOVEREIGN INTEGRITY**  
- **SOVEREIGN MANDATE**  
- **SOVEREIGN LINE**

All bound within **ARCHIVE**, sealed by **ETERNAL WITNESS**.
